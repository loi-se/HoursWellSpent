# HoursWellSpent
HoursWellSpent is an hour registration program for self-employed people / freelancers who want to keep track of their working hours.
Part of this solution are a month calendar control project and a windows form calendar control project. I tweaked these controls a bit to get the functionality I needed.

The application can also be used as an Agenda. The application uses a Windows form calendar control in combination with a Monthcalendar control to give the user an intuitive user experience.

.Net Framework 4.0 needs to be installed on your computer to use this program.

Features:

-View statistics about your worked hours.
-Register your worked hours in a Windows calendar.
-View all your agenda items in a gridview with sortable columns.
-Export your declaration report to Excell and PDF.
-Agenda's are saved in XML format.
-Export agenda view and statistical views as an Image.
-Search function.
